# Yocto/JSON: Utilities for manipulating JSON data

Yocto/JSON is an implementation of a utilities for hanlding JSON data,
including a Json variant data type, loading, saving and formatting JSON,
and a parser for command line arguments to JSON.
Compared to other libraries, it is more lightweight and provides a common
implementation for the rest of Yocto/GL.
Yocto/JSON is implemented in `yocto_json.h` and `yocto_json.cpp`, and
depends on `json.hpp`.

**This library is experimental** and will be documented appropriately when
the code reaches stability.
